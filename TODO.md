## TODO

* cli test: concurrent calls should not upload the same file twice
* remove in-progress state and use row-lock?  this may handle killing upload process more gracefully
* review all TODOs & FIXMEs
* logging events? upload succeed, upload failed etc.?

## For review:

1. test scope
2. test content
3. app code

## Future considerations?

* do we need to support migrating back?
