//    ship the bits to the database, even if they're already in there. shipping
//    bits is expensive and slow.
//    (but the old select-insert way was two separate round-trips in the did-not-exist
//    case, which wasn't great either. and it has concurrency issues.)
// 2. we /have/ to do an update on conflict in order for values to return.
//    so we just set the sha back to what we already know it is.
