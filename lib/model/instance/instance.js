// Instances are simple databags representing model records, with convenience
// methods sprinkled in to ease the readability of common tasks.
//
// Instances are defined with a table name and a set of fields. If these concepts
// are irrelevant to some given Instance (ie it doesn't actually exist in the
// database) then they can be left out or null may be given.
//
// The call signature for Instance declaration is as follows:
// Instance(tableName: String, fields: { all, readable, writable })((container) => Class)
//
// The fields are given just as arrays of strings. Again, all are optional but
// certain vanilla Instance methods will depend on the existence of these lists
// as whitelists; if they are not declared an NPE will be thrown as the field
// list is accessed.
//
// all declares all the fields in the database. It is frequently used to formulate
// complex queries (eg multi-table joins) and detangle the results.
//
// select is optional, and used in cases (eg form_defs.xml) where some field /is/
// part of all fields (of course) but we really don't want to select it unless we
// actually need it.
//
// readable and writable are declarations of what's possible via the API. the way
// we do work in Central, the fromApi and forApi methods are always the outermost
// (API-most) layer; first thing in and last thing out. As such, they are the ones
// responsible for filtering out what shouldn't be writable on the way in and what
// shouldn't be readable on the way out. Once we have an actual Instance object,
// we assume that nothing is there that oughtn't be.
//
// (This is for the reason that, for example, if forCreate() did the relevant
// filtering right before database write, it would be come difficult or contortionist
// to allow ourselves as the Central system to modify fields that the user shouldn't
// be able to.)
